			Along with this, we focus on the multiple hydroelectic power plants both in Ireland
			and around the world to sponsor new projects and concepts in hydroelectricity all
			around the world. Hydropower currently provides over 15% of the world's electricity, 
			But more is needed. Our goal is to  enable hydroelectricity and other renewables to 
			deliver against urgent net zero targets.</h3>

			<h2 class="header2"> What We Do</h2>
			<h3 class="mainText">Vineta focuses on Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, which is one of the oldest and largest sources of 
			renewable energy, using the natural flow of moving water to generate electricity. Hydroelectricity technologies generate power by 
			using the elevation difference, created by a dam or diversion structure, and the water passes through turbines, turning a motor and 
			creating electricity.</h3>
			<br>
			<h3 class="mainText">We share knowledge on these technologies through our partnerships with governments and multilateral institutions, 
			civil society, finance and academia, to create a more hydroelectricity-focused outlook on power generation in areas that suit it.</h3>
